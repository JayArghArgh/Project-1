## About This App

It allows users to find full recipes by searching using ingredients, dish names, keywords. Recipes will include features such as the time it will take to prepare as well as how many servings the recipe will yield. The user will also be able to access a wine pairing feature which will recommend great wines to pair with their recipe of choice.  Users are also able to add recipes to their favourites and email them to themselves.  When a user searches and picks any recipe that recipe is automatically saved in a quicklinks section making it easy to access previous searches.
